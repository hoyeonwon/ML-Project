# ML-Project
Using R and Python for ML Project

#### Used R for below projects:

* Personality Profiling of YouTube Vloggers: Used R to extract audiovisual, spectral, time-series features from Vloggers' transcripts to predict personality of the YouTuber
* Amazon Customer Reviews: Building a classifier that automatically recognizes customer satisfaction from textual reviews of baby products that were sold on Amazon.com. Reviews and 5-star ratings were collected by Amazon on their site by inviting customers to enter a review of a product that they had bought.
* Emotion from Facial Expression: Building an algorithm that is able to recognize emotions from photographs from facial expressions. The data set contains photos of faces that express one of the following emotions: Anger; Disgust; Happiness; Sadness
* Physical Activity Recognition: Building a classifier that recognizes different types of physical activity from signals measured by the accelerometer and gyroscope in your smartphone, which both measure aspects of movement and orientation. The data for this were collected in a lab using a basic smartphone in experiments with human participants carrying out various daily activities in set order.


#### Used Python for below project:

* Malaria Detection Using Machine Learning: Built convolutional network models to extract features for detecting Malaria in blood smear images
