These below features show more of in-depth interpretation of signals changes over time. For instance, correlations and autocorrelations would quantify the changes.\n\n* **_Level_**: It simply indicate the mean across the samples of a signal. It can inform the changes over time by detecting the dynamics in mean signals.\n* **_Power_**: It represents the average squared amplitude of the signal. Power reflects the loudness of the signal, indicating the deviation from an absolute zero of X. The loudness may differ in different activities, as the strength of each activty differs. \n* **_Energy_**: It is the total power of the n samples. It may aid on distingushing between activities as the power of the signals all differ per activity. \n* **_Entropy_**: It interprets the average surprise of an observed value from histogram. The differences show by how low or high the probabililties are: the higher the probability, the less 'surprised' you are. \n* **_Autocorrelation_**: It is interesting to extract because it aids differentiating activities; for instance, slowly changing signals have high autocorellations, while fast changing signals have low or even negative autocorrelations.\n* **_Correlation_**: They also show differences by showing the changes from one point to another; if they have high correlation, it indicates the slow changes, while high correlation shows fast changes.\n\n\n#### Sub-Time domain Features - Statistical features:\n\nHistograms give a detailed picture of the distribution of the numbers that make up the signal. Based on this, we will be extracting a less detailed characterization of the distribution, such as their location of the distribution (i.e., the _mean_), and the width of the distribtuion (_standard deviation_). These features show differences in general signals or wave forms, which could help differentiating between activities. These simple statistical summary measures often yield good predictive features. We used the following histogram features:\n* _Mean_, _Standard Deivations_, _Quantiles_, _Skewness_, _Median_, _Mode_, _Maximum and Minimum_, _Kurtosis_\n* _Standard Error_, _Root Mean Squared_\n\n#### Frequency domain features: \n\nFrequency domain features show how signals are presented over each frequency band. This could be detected by signal spectrum that compares between different activities in each frequency band. \n\n* **_Mean frequency_**: We used general mean frequency to find which activity has higher mean frequency and what not. \n* **_Spectral peak, spectral mean frequency, spectral standard deviation, spectral entropy_**:\n    - The spectrum of a signal shows which frequencies a signal is composed of. It shows the number of fluctuations, including signals like a walking patterns ... etc. Peaks show the strength in which peaks are presented. Notice that height of each frequency is the square of a linear regression coefficient, meaning we can use to predict the signals from a wave. These spectral features can be used as a probability density function as well (ex, mean frequency). \n \n#### Other features:\n \n* **_Convolutions_**: For pattern recognition we used convolution. Convolution is a filter that passes over for example an image and extracting features that show a commonolatity in the image (signals) such that if the image has certain features, it belongs to a particular class. Thus, aiding in detecting activity. \n* **_Zero crossings_**: It measures how many times the waveform crosses the zero axis. With zero crossing we are able to see whether the sign of a signal changed. Since our goal is to distinguish different physical activities this can be useful. \n* **_Coefficient variance_**: It is the spread of the values in the epoch. The differences in values can be an indication of which signals in each epoch are different per activities. \n* **_Width/heigth ratio_**: It is the ratio of width and height of the wave. This is an unstandardized method, which we aim to learn the differences in proportion of width and heigh of each signals per activity. \n* **_Signal Magnitude Area (SMA)_**: statistical measure of the magnitude of a varying quantity that shows indication of different area in each signal.\n\n#### Features we did not use:\n\n* **_Amount of peaks_**: Here we counted the amount of peaks that could be found in the epoch, as in different activities, we can see different amount of peaks. We thought it could be a good predictor for detecting which activity belongs to how many amount of peaks.\n* **_Difference between highest and lowest peak_**: As seen in one of the earlier diagrams you can see that sitting has a small difference between signals while wallking has a lot higher peaks then their valleys so this could help define the different classes.\n* **_Average distance between the valleys_**: The amount of time that passed between signals also seemed to differ accros the different classes. So here we look at the distance between valleys and average it.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### References\n* Reyes-Ortiz, J. L., Oneto, L., Samà, A., Parra, X., & Anguita, D.

Model fitting\n## 4.1 Linear Discriminant Analysis\nLinear discriminant analysis (LDA) is one of the classification methods that is bascially a linear regression analysis with a dichotomous outcome (0 or 1). The characteristics of LDA is that it can 1) formulate for any distribution, 2) models distribution of the predictor variables within each class k, and uses Bayes theorem to compute the posterior probability that an observation belongs to class k, 3) assumes a normal distribution for X. If the normal distribution is correct, LDA's decision boundaries are the Bayes decision boundaries that yield the lowest number of misclassifications among all classification models. Thus, we are using LDA to fit our predictors. (ISLR Chapter 4)\n\nFor validating the model, we used k = 10 because typically, k = 5 or 10 are ideal values to yield test error rate estimates that suffer neither from excessively high bias nor from very high variance, so we chose k = 10 as our cross validation.\n\nFINE TUNING AND STEPWISE REGRESSION FOR LDA\n* During the process of finding ways to tune LDA, we found out that according to the documentation LDA has no tuning parameters.\n    - http://topepo.github.io/caret/available-models.html\n* We tried using stepLDA to fit stepwise regression for LDA, but due to high computational power it did not successfully run, so we decided to leave it out.\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"689e96162446707ee9e88a4c229d169f76290b62"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"## Fitting classifier models\n# 10-fold\ntrcntr = caret::trainControl('cv', number = 10) \n\n#fitting Linear Discriminant Analysis\nfit_lda = caret::train(activity ~ ., data = myData_cleanM, method=\"lda\", trControl = trcntr, na.action = na.pass)\nfit_lda","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-09-28T15:29:07.373532Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-09-28T15:29:07.376229Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-09-28T15:29:10.899272Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 4.2 K-Nearest Neighbors\n\nK-nearest neighbors (KNN) is a non-parametric approach, meaning it does not assume anything of the decision boundary. One of the advantages of non-parametric model is that it can display better output when the decision boundary is non-linear. Since we have a lot of observations, we would expect less bias outcome. The flexibility of KNN would thus be appropriate for our model. \n\nTUNING\n* According to the documentation knn has one tuning parameter: k\n* For the ideal amount of k sould be the squarroot of the amount of samples we have.

We added several features, including features we came up with ourselves based on literature research. Unfortunately, we were not able to use all the features we came up with. For instance, while reading different literatures, we found out that package quantmod provides some fruitful information about the signals. Thus we tried to extract the mathematical formulas out of the package, but due to the difficulty of recreating the package and time pressure, we ended up not using the features. We fitted several models to our data to predict the activities. All accuracies are visualized in the plot under the heading “model comparison”. As can be clearly seen there, the cross-validated knn model gave the best accuracy, as well as smallest range of confidence intervals. However, due to the curse of dimensionality, knn is more prone to overfitting. Although feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques can be used to avoid this, the results should still be interpreted with caution. In the future, other features, such as the peak and valley feature could be added to investigate whether this improves accuracy. For instance, it seems to be hard to distinguish between 'Lie to sit' and 'Lie to stand' based on the confusion matrix: while 'Lie to stand' was correctly classified with 'Lie to stand' 19 times, 'Lie to sit' to 'Lie to stand' was incorrectly classified for 11 times. This indicates that those two categories are quite similar, which could possibly be improved with peaks and valleys features.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Sub-Section: Peaks and Valleys:\nWhen looking at the plot below (same as earlier) we see that different activities have different values for the signals. We also see in this plot that there is a clear difference between the vallues that are associated with walking downstair and laying for example. one difference we see is that the average of the signal for walking downstairs is higher then for laying. We also see that the amount of higher/lower values for walking down stairs seems to be higher then those for laying. So here we can definately see some reasons to think that peaks and valleys of a time period could help distinguis the different activities from eachother.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"options(repr.plot.width=15) # change plot width for nicer output\n\nuser_df %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = sampleid, y = X1, col = factor(activity), group=segment)) + \n      geom_line()  ","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-09-28T15:48:46.15241Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-09-28T15:48:46.154457Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-09-28T15:48:47.130108Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To do this we first used a package (quantmod) which has an algorithm that compairs a time x with its time x-1 and a time x+1.
