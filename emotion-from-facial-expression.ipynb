Introduction\n## Data considerations\n\nThis project aims to build an algorithm to detect emotions from images with four different kinds of facial expressions: anger, disgust, happiness, and sadness. Before diving into the analysis, we would like to give an overview of how the data was collected: \n\n**1. Where do the data come from? (To which population will results generalize?)**\n* The data comes from the expanded Cohn-Kanada (CK+) database, which is released to promote research on detecting facial expressions (Lucey, et al., 2010; p. 1). The databse contains 101 pictures of participants, where the age range is 18 to 50, and 69% female, 81%, Euro-American, 13% Afro-American, and 6% other groups (Lucey, et al., 2010; p. 1).\n* As can be seen, the data is only generalizable to Euro/ American enthnicity, meaning other groups are not represented well by the data. Furthermore, the participants for the study were composed of actors or actresses, meaning they would fake their facial expressions to look more extreme than in real life. \n\n**2. What are candidate machine learning methods? (models? features?)**\n* As the problem issues binary outcomes, we can classify this problem as a binary classification problem. The  candidates are:\n<div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction: row; flex-wrap: nowrap; align-items: stretch; width:100%;\">\n    <div style=\"display:inline-block;width:45%;\">\n        <ul>\n<h5> Model Candidates: </h5>          \n<li> LDA\n<li> QDA\n<li> KNN \n<li> LASSO and RIDGE\n<li> Support Vector Machines\n<li> Tree and Random Forest\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n    <div style=\"display:inline-block;width:45%;\">\n        <ul>\n<h5> Feature Candidates: </h5>  \n<li> Spectral Features from Histogram Analysis\n<li> Edge Features Using Frey Slate Functions\n<li> Histogram related gradients and other features\n<li> Bag of features - which we did not explore\n        </ul>\n    </div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**3. What is the Bayes' error bound? (Any guestimate from scientific literature or web resources?)**\n* As always, we assum humans are good at recognizing facial expressions. Although in reality, some facial expressions could be very subtle. \n* To have an idea of a lower bound on the Bayes bound (i.e., the minimum accuracy that should be achievable). The best 'machine' we have at hand to recognize emotion from facial expression in the human brain. How often do human judges get it correct? In a study by Mollahosseini et al. (2018) an estimate for human classification inter-rater agreement was obtained for 11 emotions. For the four included in this data set they are:\n\n\n| disgust  |  anger  |  happy  |  sad  |\n|---------:|--------:|--------:|-------|\n|  67.6%   | 62.3%   | 79.6%   | 69.7% |\n\n\nKeep this in mind when evaluating the performance of the classifiers that you'll train.\n\nAs always, it's handy to evaluate how the algorithm does on the training set: If the training set is not classified accurately, how can you expect the test set to do any better. This obvious fact is often overlooked—surprisingly.\n\n--------------------------------","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.

It can inform the changes over time by detecting the dynamics in mean signals.\n* **_Power_**: It represents the average squared amplitude of the signal. Power reflects the loudness of the signal, indicating the deviation from an absolute zero of X. The loudness may differ in different activities, as the strength of each activty differs. \n* **_Energy_**: It is the total power of the n samples. It may aid on distingushing between activities as the power of the signals all differ per activity. \n* **_Entropy_**: It interprets the average surprise of an observed value from histogram. The differences show by how low or high the probabililties are: the higher the probability, the less 'surprised' you are. \n\n* Based on characteristics of histogram, we extracted statistical features as well; giving information about their location of the distribution and width of the distribution:\n    - _Mean_, _Standard Deivations_, _Quantiles_, _Skewness_, _Median_, _Mode_, _Maximum and Minimum_, _Kurtosis_\n    - _Standard Error_, _Root Mean Squared_\n\n* Based on the frequency of the band, we used signal spectruem to compare different facial expressions:\n     - **_Mean frequency_**: We used general mean frequency to find which facial expression has higher mean frequency and what not. \n     - **_Spectral peak, spectral mean frequency, spectral standard deviation, spectral entropy_**:\n    - The spectrum of a signal shows which frequencies a signal is composed of. It shows the number of fluctuations, including signals like a walking patterns ... etc. Peaks show the strength in which peaks are presented. Notice that height of each frequency is the square of a linear regression coefficient, meaning we can use to predict the signals from a wave. These spectral features can be used as a probability density function as well (ex, mean frequency). \n    \n* **_Convolutions_**: For pattern recognition we used convolution. Convolution is a filter that passes over for example an image and extracting features that show a commonolatity in the images such that if the image has certain features, it belongs to a particular class. Thus, aiding in detecting facial expression. \n* **_Coefficient variance_**: It is the spread of the values in the epoch. The differences in values can be an indication of which signals in each epoch are different per facial expressions. \n* **_Width/heigth ratio_**: It is the ratio of width and height of the wave. This is an unstandardized method, which we aim to learn the differences in proportion of width and heigh per facial expression. \n* **_Magnitude Pixel Area_**: It is the absolute sum of the pixels. The sum of each pixels can aid differentiating different facial expressions, as the absolute sums are all different.\n\n**FUNCTION CREATION:**\n\nFeatures function are created to aid the calculation simplification.

The Lasso\nNext up is the Lasso. The Lasso is a shrinkage method and a clear improvement over the Ridge regression. Ridge regression will always include all $p$ predictors in the final model. This is because the penalty in ridge regression will shrink all of the coefficients very very close to zero, but it will not actually set any of them to actual zero. This is an issue in model interpretation when the number of variables $p$ is quite large (James et al., 2013).\n\nThe Lasso uses a different penalty and shrinks all coefficient estimates to zero, however the $l1$ penalty forces some of the estimates down to exactly zero as the tuning parameter Lambda increases.

Our objective is to find a plane that has the maximum margin, i.e the maximum distance between data points of both classes.
